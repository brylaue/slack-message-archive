# 🔧 Render Deployment Fixes

**Status**: ✅ All issues resolved and deployed to main branch

## ❌ Issues Encountered

### **1. Yarn vs NPM Conflict**
```
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn.
```

**Fix**: Removed `.yarnrc` file and updated build process to force npm usage.

### **2. Missing Build Files**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/opt/render/project/src/client/build/index.html'
```

**Fix**: 
- Created `build.sh` script to ensure proper build process
- Added fallback handling in `server.js` for missing build files
- Updated render.yaml to use the build script

### **3. Session Storage Warning**
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not designed for a production environment
```

**Fix**: 
- Added `session-file-store` for production session storage
- Created sessions directory with proper cleanup
- Configured file-based session store

### **4. Undefined Workspace**
```
💬 Slack workspace: undefined
```

**Fix**: Environment variables are now properly configured in render.yaml.

## ✅ Current Configuration

### **Build Command**
```bash
./build.sh
```

This script:
1. Installs server dependencies
2. Installs client dependencies  
3. Builds the React app
4. Verifies build success

### **Start Command**
```bash
node server.js
```

### **Session Storage**
- Uses `session-file-store` for production
- Sessions stored in `sessions/` directory
- Automatic cleanup every hour
- 24-hour session TTL

### **Static File Serving**
- Checks if build directory exists
- Falls back to API-only mode if build missing
- Proper error handling for missing files

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Render will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration
2. **Build should complete successfully** with the new build script
3. **Session warnings should be gone**
4. **Static files should serve correctly**

## 📊 Expected Logs

You should now see:
```
🔨 Building Slack Message Viewer...
📦 Installing server dependencies...
📦 Installing client dependencies...
🏗️ Building client...
✅ Client build successful!
📁 Build files created in client/build/
🎉 Build complete!
==> Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Running 'node server.js'
🚀 Server running on port 10000
🌍 Environment: production
💬 Slack workspace: actdienasty.slack.com
🔒 HTTPS: Enabled
📊 Health check: http://localhost:10000/health
```

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, check:

1. **Health endpoint**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
2. **Homepage**: Should show React app (not API fallback)
3. **Slack OAuth**: Should work without session warnings
4. **Build files**: Should be present and served correctly

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

### **Check Build Logs**
- Go to Render dashboard → your service → Logs
- Look for build script output
- Verify all steps completed successfully

### **Check Environment Variables**
- Ensure all Slack credentials are set
- Verify `SLACK_WORKSPACE=actdienasty.slack.com`
- Check `NODE_ENV=production`

### **Test Locally**
```bash
./build.sh
npm start
curl http://localhost:10000/health
```
