# 🔧 Build Process Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Render deployment shows API fallback instead of React app

## 🔍 Current Status

The server is falling back to API-only mode because the React build files aren't being created during the Render build process.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### **1. Simplified Build Command**
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install
```

This triggers the `postinstall` script automatically:
```json
"postinstall": "cd client && npm install && npm run build"
```

### **2. Added Debugging**
The server now logs:
- ✅ Build directory found/not found
- 📁 Current directory contents
- 🔍 Debug information in API response

### **3. Fixed Client Configuration**
- Added `"homepage": "."` to client/package.json
- Ensured proper build output location

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

After the fix, you should see:

### **In Render Build Logs:**
```
==> Running build command 'npm install'...
==> npm install
==> cd client && npm install && npm run build
==> Creating an optimized production build...
==> Build successful 🎉
```

### **In Server Logs:**
```
✅ Build directory found: /opt/render/project/src/client/build
🚀 Server running on port 10000
```

### **In Browser:**
- Should show React app (not API fallback)
- Login screen with Slack OAuth button

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### **1. Check Render Build Logs**
- Go to Render dashboard → your service → Logs
- Look for build process output
- Check for any error messages

### **2. Check Server Logs**
- Look for "Build directory found" or "Build directory not found"
- Check current directory contents

### **3. Test API Endpoint**
Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/`

If you still see the API fallback, the response will include debug information:
```json
{
  "message": "Slack Message Viewer API",
  "status": "running", 
  "build": "not found - check build process",
  "debug": {
    "currentDir": "/opt/render/project/src",
    "buildPath": "/opt/render/project/src/client/build",
    "exists": false,
    "contents": ["server.js", "package.json", ...]
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Manual Fixes

### **If Build Still Fails:**

1. **Check package-lock.json exists**
   ```bash
   # Should exist in both root and client directories
   ls -la package-lock.json
   ls -la client/package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Test build locally**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client && npm install && npm run build
   ```

3. **Check build output**
   ```bash
   ls -la client/build/
   # Should contain index.html and static/ directory
   ```

### **If Render Still Uses Yarn:**

1. **Force npm in render.yaml**
   ```yaml
   envVars:
     - key: NPM_CONFIG_PREFER_OFFLINE
       value: true
   ```

2. **Add .npmrc file**
   ```
   engine-strict=true
   package-lock=true
   ```

## 📊 Success Indicators

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Build logs show "Build successful 🎉"
- ✅ Server logs show "Build directory found"
- ✅ Homepage shows React app (not API fallback)
- ✅ `/health` endpoint works
- ✅ Slack OAuth button visible

## 🆘 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Render to redeploy** (automatic after push)
2. **Check build logs** for success/failure
3. **Test the homepage** - should show React app
4. **If still failing**, check the debug information in the API response

**🎯 The build process should now work correctly with the simplified configuration!**
